\paragraph{Q57}
 Suppose \(r_{1.23}\) and \(r_{1.234}\) are sample multiple correlation coefficients of \(X_1\) on \(X_2,X_3\) and \(X_1\) on \(X_2,X_3,X_4\) respectively. Which of the following is possible?\\\\
1. \quad \(r_{1.23} = -0.3\) and \(r_{1.234} = 0.7\)\\
2. \quad \(r_{1.23} = 0.7\) and \(r_{1.234} = 0.3\)\\
3. \quad \(r_{1.23} = 0.3\) and \(r_{1.234} = 0.7\)\\
4. \quad \(r_{1.23} = 0.7\) and \(r_{1.234} = -0.3\)\\

\paragraph{Coefficient Of Multiple Correlation:}
The coefficient of multiple correlation, denoted R, is a scalar that is defined as the Pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted and the actual values of the dependent variable in a linear regression model that includes an intercept.
\\\\
The coefficient of multiple correlation(R) is known as the square root of the coefficient of determination(\(R^2\))
\\\\
for any multi-linear regression model \(R^2\) can be calculated using the formula given bellow\\
\begin{equation}
    R^2 = 1 - \frac{sum squared regression (SSR)}{total sum of squares (SST)}
\end{equation}\begin{equation}
    R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum(y_i - \hat{y_i})}{\sum(y_i - \Bar{y})}\\
\end{equation}
where,\\
\hspace*{1em} \quad \quad    \(y_i\) is actual value,\\
\hspace*{1em} \quad \quad    \(\hat{y_i}\) is predicted value,\\
\hspace*{1em} \quad \quad    and \(\Bar{y}\) is mean of y values.
\paragraph{Solution}
 From equation 2 we can see that value of coefficient of multiple correlation can't be negative, also if we introduce more variables, the \(R^2\) will always increase, it can never decrease. This follows mathematically from the observation that,\\
\begin{equation}
    (y - \beta_0 - \beta_1x_1 - \dots - \beta_px_p - \beta_{p+1}x_{p+1})^2 \leq (y - \beta_0 - \beta_1x_1 - \dots - \beta_px_p)^2
\end{equation}
\\
\textbf{Hence by looking at options we can say that option 3(\(r_{1.23} = 0.3\) and \(r_{1.234} = 0.7\)) is the correct answer}
